WeftEnd Quickstart (5 minutes)

What WeftEnd is (short)
- Deterministic intake + evidence receipts.
- Compare against a baseline to see what changed.
- Privacy-clean outputs you can attach to tickets.
See docs/WHAT_IS_WEFTEND.md and docs/WHY_RECEIPTS.md for the full explanation.

1) Install (Windows, per-user)
- Run tools\windows\INSTALL_WINDOWS.cmd
- This sets the context menu and runs shell doctor.

2) First run (right-click)
- Right-click any file or folder -> Run with WeftEnd
- Read report_card.txt (opens immediately)
- Native binaries are WITHHELD by design (analysis-only)

3) Compare (optional)
- Run again after any change.
- Use: npm run weftend -- compare <oldOut> <newOut> --out <diffOut>
- Read compare_report.txt

3.5) Optional launcher shortcut
- Create a WeftEnd-run shortcut:
  npm run weftend -- shortcut create --target <path-to-app.exe> --allow-launch

3.6) Launchpad (panel) - experimental
- Drop files/folders into: %LOCALAPPDATA%\WeftEnd\Library\Launchpad\Targets
- Run: npm run weftend -- launchpad sync --allow-launch --open-library
- Open Start Menu: "WeftEnd Launchpad" (small panel window)

4) Open the Library
- Start Menu: "WeftEnd Library" shortcut
- Or: npm run weftend -- library

5) Grab the portable bundle (optional)
- Start Menu: "WeftEnd Download" shortcut
- Drag the .zip from the release folder to a USB drive

Notes
- No cloud. No telemetry. No automatic execution.
- Host execution is optional and off by default.
- Receipts are deterministic and privacy-clean.
