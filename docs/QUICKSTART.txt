WeftEnd Quickstart (5 minutes)

What WeftEnd is (short)
- Deterministic evidence + change tracking + change control.
- Compare against a baseline to see what changed.
- Privacy-clean outputs you can attach to tickets.
See docs/WHAT_IS_WEFTEND.md and docs/WHY_RECEIPTS.md for details.

1) Install (Windows, per-user)
- Run tools\windows\INSTALL_WINDOWS.cmd
- This installs right-click entries and runs shell doctor checks.
- Start Menu shortcuts installed by default:
  - WeftEnd Launchpad
  - WeftEnd Download
- Cross-platform note: CLI works on Windows/macOS/Linux (Node.js required).
- Windows shell integration is Windows-only.

2) First run (right-click)
- Right-click any file or folder -> Run with WeftEnd
- Report card opens in the WeftEnd viewer by default.
- Native binaries are WITHHELD by design (analysis-first).
- webLane=NOT_APPLICABLE is normal for non-web artifacts.
- On CHANGED runs, review delta= and SIGNAL lines before accepting baseline.

3) Compare (optional)
- Run again after any change.
- Use:
  npm run weftend -- compare <oldOut> <newOut> --out <diffOut>
- Read compare_report.txt

3.1) Universal artifact adapter lane (CLI)
- List adapter coverage:
  npm run weftend -- adapter list
- Run safe-run with adapter auto-detect:
  npm run weftend -- safe-run <input> --out <dir> --adapter auto
- Force a specific adapter:
  npm run weftend -- safe-run <input> --out <dir> --adapter archive
- Enable optional local plugin explicitly when needed:
  npm run weftend -- safe-run <input> --out <dir> --adapter archive --enable-plugin tar
- Adapter artifacts (when adapter is applied):
  analysis/adapter_summary_v0.json
  analysis/adapter_findings_v0.json

4) Launchpad (no CLI after install)
- Open Start Menu -> WeftEnd Launchpad
- Add shortcuts/apps in:
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\WeftEnd\Library\Launchpad\Targets
- Click Sync, then run items from Launchpad.
- Behavior:
  - SAME vs baseline: launch allowed.
  - CHANGED/BLOCKED vs baseline: explicit accept/decline flow.

5) Bind/unbind to WeftEnd (right-click)
- Right-click a file/shortcut/folder:
  - Bind to WeftEnd
  - Unbind from WeftEnd
- For .lnk rewrap mode, WeftEnd preserves icon and can restore original shortcut state on unbind.

6) Open Library and ticket packs
- Right-click target -> Run with WeftEnd (Open Library)
- On CHANGED runs, WeftEnd can prompt to create a ticket pack.
- CLI alternative:
  npm run weftend -- library
  npm run weftend -- ticket-pack <outRoot> --out <ticketDir> --zip

7) Builder integration (for tools built on top)
- Export deterministic integration JSON:
  npm run weftend -- export-json <outRoot> --format normalized_v0
- Contract: weftend.normalizedSummary/0
- Policy/usage boundary: docs/POWERED_BY_WEFTEND.md

8) Portable bundle
- Open Start Menu -> WeftEnd Download
- Use weftend_*_portable.zip for field/offline operator use.
- Runtime is never auto-downloaded: bundled runtime/node/node.exe is preferred; local Node fallback is fail-closed.

Notes
- No cloud. No telemetry. No malware scoring.
- Host execution is optional and off by default.
- Receipts are deterministic and privacy-clean.
- WeftEnd is evidence support; operators remain responsible for decisions (see docs/DISCLAIMER.md).
