WeftEnd Quickstart (5 minutes)

What WeftEnd is (short)
- Deterministic evidence + change tracking + change control.
- Compare against a baseline to see what changed.
- Privacy-clean outputs you can attach to tickets.
See docs/WHAT_IS_WEFTEND.md and docs/WHY_RECEIPTS.md for the full explanation.

1) Install (Windows, per-user)
- Run tools\windows\INSTALL_WINDOWS.cmd
- This sets the context menu and runs shell doctor.
- Cross-platform note: CLI works on Windows/macOS/Linux (Node.js required).
- Windows shell integration is Windows-only; macOS/Linux integration is planned.

2) First run (right-click)
- Right-click any file or folder -> Run with WeftEnd
- Read report_card.txt (opens immediately)
- Native binaries are WITHHELD by design (analysis-only)
- `webLane=NOT_APPLICABLE` is normal for non-web artifacts
- On CHANGED runs, read the `delta=` line before compare

3) Compare (optional)
- Run again after any change.
- Use: npm run weftend -- compare <oldOut> <newOut> --out <diffOut>
- Read compare_report.txt

3.5) Optional launcher shortcut
- Create a WeftEnd-run shortcut:
  npm run weftend -- shortcut create --target <path-to-app.exe> --allow-launch

3.6) Launchpad (no CLI after install)
- Open Start Menu -> "WeftEnd Launchpad"
- Drop shortcuts/apps into: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WeftEnd\Library\Launchpad\Targets`
- Click `Sync`, then click a launchpad item.
- Behavior:
  - SAME vs baseline: app opens normally.
  - CHANGED vs baseline: app does not open until baseline is accepted.

3.7) Optional operator menu (no CLI)
- Open Start Menu -> "WeftEnd"
- Use buttons for:
  - Safe-Run (pick file/folder)
  - Open Library
  - Compare two runs
  - Create ticket pack
  - Shell doctor
  - Install/Uninstall context menu

3.8) Optional advanced watch mode (CLI)
- `npm run weftend -- watch <target>`
- This is optional; baseline acceptance remains manual.

4) Open the Library
- Start Menu: "WeftEnd Library" shortcut
- Or: npm run weftend -- library

5) Grab the portable bundle (optional)
- Start Menu: "WeftEnd Download" shortcut
- Drag the .zip from the release folder to a USB drive

Notes
- No cloud. No telemetry. No automatic execution.
- Host execution is optional and off by default.
- Receipts are deterministic and privacy-clean.
- WeftEnd is evidence support; operators remain responsible for decisions (see docs/DISCLAIMER.md).
