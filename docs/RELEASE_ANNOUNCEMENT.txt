WeftEnd Alpha Update

This release combines operator UX polish with trust/runtime hardening and shell workflow reliability updates.

Highlights
1. Report viewing defaults to the native WeftEnd report viewer.
2. Report viewer host console now launches hidden while the report card window stays visible for review.
3. Launchpad History supports direct report viewing (button, double-click, Enter).
4. CHANGED/BLOCKED baseline accept/decline flow is restored and hardened.
5. Structured report artifacts are available: report_card_v0.json and report_card.txt.
6. Shortcut analysis resolves real .lnk targets/scripts for accurate compare behavior.
7. New right-click bind flow:
   - Bind to WeftEnd
   - Unbind from WeftEnd
8. .lnk rewrap bind mode preserves icon and restores original shortcut on unbind.
9. Shell integration is simplified to two shortcuts:
   - WeftEnd Launchpad
   - WeftEnd Download
10. Builder integration surface is documented and available:
    - weftend export-json <outRoot> --format normalized_v0
    - contract: weftend.normalizedSummary/0
11. Core/runtime trust hardening sweep is included in release scope.
