WeftEnd Alpha Update

This release expands WeftEnd as a deterministic universal artifact meter while hardening release-gate discipline and operator-facing workflow reliability.

Highlights
1. Universal adapter lane expanded (analysis-only, deterministic, fail-closed):
   - safe-run adapter routes: auto|none|archive|package|extension|iac|cicd|document|container|image|scm|signature
   - explicit plugin routing: --enable-plugin <name> (local-only, no auto-install)
   - deterministic adapter artifacts: analysis/adapter_summary_v0.json, analysis/adapter_findings_v0.json
2. Adapter maintenance controls added:
   - weftend adapter list
   - weftend adapter doctor [--text] [--strict]
   - weftend adapter doctor --write-policy <path> [--include-missing-plugins]
   - fail-closed lane disable policy support for controlled maintenance windows
3. Verify gate (360) hardened for strict release use:
   - npm run verify:360
   - npm run verify:360:release
   - npm run verify:360:release:cleanout
   - npm run verify:360:release:managed
   - gate preserves evidence on PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL and records explicit policy/doctor context
4. GitHub Actions workflows included:
   - .github/workflows/weftend_artifact_meter.yml
   - .github/workflows/weftend_verify360.yml
5. Docs and release discipline hardening:
   - release-facing docs now have contract coverage to prevent workflow/command drift
   - release checklist includes workflow parity checks and immutable-change-record checks
6. Existing operator UX/security hardening remains in place:
   - native report viewer default, with safe fallback behavior
   - launchpad CHANGED/BLOCKED accept/decline flow restored
   - .lnk target resolution and bind/unbind workflow hardening
