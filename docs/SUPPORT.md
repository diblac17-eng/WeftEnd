# SUPPORT

This document defines what WeftEnd support is, what it is not, and how to request help.

Scope (what support covers)
- Interpreting report cards, receipts, and compare reports.
- Baseline / library workflows (SAME, CHANGED, BLOCKED).
- Installation and environment setup (shell integration, output roots).
- Operational guidance (how to use WeftEnd for change tracking).

Non-scope (what support does NOT provide)
- No security guarantees or malware verdicts.
- No promises of prevention or compliance certification.
- No remote access to your systems.
- No data collection or telemetry.

Support levels (simple, honest)
- Community: issues and questions via your public tracker.
- Paid support: prioritized responses and operational guidance.

Paid support is about interpretation and operational guidance, not software access.

Free vs premium (positioning)
- The core tool is fully functional for personal/manual use.
- Premium is convenience + scale for organizations (automation, deployment, and support), not different truth.

Premium convenience examples
- Launchpad deployment across many PCs (premium)
- Auto-scan/watch folder workflows (premium)
- Ticket-pack automation and standardized evidence bundles (premium)
- Priority support and onboarding (premium)

Contact
- Support contact: GitHub Issues (public alpha). Paid support contact provided on request.
- Pricing reference: `docs/PRICING.md` (premium only).
- Premium operations: `docs/PREMIUM_OPERATIONS.md`
- Premium limits: `docs/PREMIUM_LIMITS.md`
- Support intake checklist: `docs/SUPPORT_INTAKE.md`

Response expectations
- Best-effort, no guaranteed response time unless explicitly contracted.
- No sensitive data in tickets.

Notes
- WeftEnd is offline-first and privacy-clean by design.
- Support interactions should never require sharing raw artifacts.
