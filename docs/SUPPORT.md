# SUPPORT

This document defines what WeftEnd support is, what it is not, and how to request help.

Scope (what support covers)
- Interpreting report cards, receipts, and compare reports.
- Baseline / library workflows (SAME, CHANGED, BLOCKED).
- Installation and environment setup (shell integration, output roots).
- Operational guidance (how to use WeftEnd for change tracking).

Non-scope (what support does NOT provide)
- No security guarantees or malware verdicts.
- No promises of prevention or compliance certification.
- No remote access to your systems.
- No data collection or telemetry.

Liability and decision ownership
- WeftEnd is evidence support, not a legal or safety authority.
- Operators and organizations remain responsible for all decisions taken from WeftEnd outputs.
- See `docs/DISCLAIMER.md`.

Support levels (simple, honest)
- Community: issues and questions via your public tracker.
- Business support (by inquiry): possible on a case-by-case basis; not promised and not a feature.

Business support is about interpretation and operational guidance, not software access.

Contact
- Support contact: WeftEnd@aol.com
- Support intake checklist: `docs/SUPPORT_INTAKE.md`

Response expectations
- Best-effort, no guaranteed response time unless explicitly contracted.
- No sensitive data in tickets.

Notes
- WeftEnd is offline-first and privacy-clean by design.
- Support interactions should never require sharing raw artifacts.

Support WeftEnd (optional)
- Donations are welcome if this tool saves you time.
