# PREMIUM_LIMITS.md

Premium provides automation and support. It does not change WeftEnd’s trust model.

## Explicit limits
- No malware verdicts or prevention guarantees.
- No automatic execution of native binaries.
- No cloud telemetry or hidden data collection.
- No compliance certification.

## Why these limits exist
WeftEnd’s value is deterministic evidence and repeatable comparison.
Premium exists to **scale** that workflow, not to change the truth model.
