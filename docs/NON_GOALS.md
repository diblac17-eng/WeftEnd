# WeftEnd Non-Goals (Frozen)

WeftEnd is infrastructure for trust-first execution and publishing. It is not:

## Not DRM / Not Anti-Copy
- WeftEnd does not prevent copying, redistribution, or reverse engineering.
- WeftEnd does not enforce business models or ownership.

## Not Surveillance / Not Identity
- WeftEnd does not identify users, devices, accounts, or sessions.
- Core truth artifacts contain no stable identifiers and no wall-clock time.
- Telemetry is local-first and aggregate-only by default.

## Not a Content Correctness Oracle
- WeftEnd does not prove that content is true, correct, safe, or legal.
- It proves provenance, bindings, policies, and bounded execution outcomes.

## Not a Blockchain Replacement / Financial System
- WeftEnd is not a ledger, token system, or consensus network.
- It does not replace markets; it provides verifiable artifacts and receipts.

## Not Real-Time Anti-Cheat Gating
- WeftEnd does not do hot-path, real-time enforcement for games.
- Shadow audit is post-hoc and proof-only.

## Not Heuristic / AI Detection
- WeftEnd does not rely on heuristics to grant trust.
- It does not best-effort repair trust or silently fall back in strict mode.

## Not Obfuscation-Based Security
- WeftEnd does not treat secrecy/obfuscation as a trust primitive.
- Trust is derived from proofs, bindings, and fail-closed gates.
