# DISCLAIMER

WeftEnd is an evidence and change-tracking tool.

What WeftEnd does:
- Produces deterministic receipts and compare outputs.
- Helps operators document what changed between runs.

What WeftEnd does not do:
- It does not guarantee safety, prevention, or compliance outcomes.
- It does not make legal determinations or assign fault.
- It does not replace operator judgment, policy, or approval authority.

Liability scope:
- WeftEnd outputs are decision support artifacts.
- Decisions taken from those artifacts remain the responsibility of the operator and organization using the tool.
- Use is provided under the project license terms (see `LICENSE`).

Practical model:
- Treat WeftEnd as a lens for evidence, not an oracle for truth.
