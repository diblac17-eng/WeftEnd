WeftEnd Alpha 0.2 (Public Alpha)
Scope: Deterministic evidence, change tracking, change control, receipts, compare, local library, and portable-first runtime packaging.
Liability scope: WeftEnd is an evidence lens, not a safety/compliance guarantee engine.

Included
- Deterministic intake of files, folders, zips, and web exports.
- Privacy-clean, bounded receipts and report cards.
- WITHHELD posture for native binaries (analysis-only by default).
- Local, append-only report library with baseline + compare view.
- Deterministic compare between runs.
- Windows right-click flow (per-user) with Open Library option.
- Portable release bundle with SHA-256 verification.
- Two release artifacts: standard zip and portable zip with bundled runtime.

Not included
- Malware scoring or reputation.
- Cloud analysis or telemetry.
- Automatic execution of native binaries.
- Publishing / block market ecosystem.

Known limitations (by design)
- Native executables are analysis-only unless explicitly installed into a host.
- Receipts are deterministic snapshots, not live monitoring.
- No automatic trust roots or keys are generated.
- Operators and organizations remain responsible for decisions based on outputs.

Verification
- Standard and portable release zips each ship with a .sha256 file.
- Run the release checklist before tagging/publishing.
- Use the release zip, not the GitHub auto-generated Source code archives.
- See docs/DISCLAIMER.md for legal scope and non-guarantees.
