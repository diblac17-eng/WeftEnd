WeftEnd Alpha Update (Windows Shell + Trust Hardening)
Date: 2026-02-13
Scope: Deterministic artifact intake, baseline/compare workflows, operator-facing report cards, and Windows shell reliability hardening.
Liability scope: WeftEnd is an evidence and change-tracking engine, not a malware oracle or compliance guarantee.

Included
- 360 commit gate added:
- `npm run verify:360` now performs compile/test/proofcheck + deterministic replay + privacy lint + compare smoke.
- Gate now always writes evidence artifacts (`verify_360_receipt.json` and `verify_360_report.txt`) for PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL outcomes.
- Host precondition misses are explicit PARTIAL/SKIP evidence, not silent no-output aborts.
- Gate enforces docs/update discipline: code changes without operator-facing doc updates fail with `VERIFY360_DOC_SYNC_MISSING`.
- Gate now uses explicit state progression and two-phase output finalize (`stage -> finalize`) with `verify_360_output_manifest.json`.
- Universal artifact adapter expansion (analysis-only, deterministic, fail-closed):
- New safe-run adapter flags: `--adapter auto|none|archive|package|extension|iac|cicd|document|container|image|scm|signature`
- Optional repeatable plugin flag: `--enable-plugin <name>` (explicit local plugin use only)
- New adapter discovery command: `weftend adapter list`
- Additive receipt/summary surface:
- `safe_run_receipt.json` optional `adapter` metadata block
- `contentSummary.adapterSignals` optional deterministic adapter signal block
- Optional adapter artifacts in run output:
- `analysis/adapter_summary_v0.json`
- `analysis/adapter_findings_v0.json`
- Package/extension ZIP metadata extraction deepened for deterministic manifest signals:
- `.msix/.nupkg/.whl/.jar` manifest text hints are now extracted from ZIP entries (bounded, analysis-only).
- `.crx/.vsix` now parse `manifest.json` when present in ZIP payloads (permissions/content scripts/update URL domain hints).
- `.xpi` extension bundles are now supported through the same deterministic ZIP-manifest path.
- `.crx` strict route now validates CRX wrapper header and embedded ZIP payload before manifest analysis, failing closed on malformed CRX payloads.
- Linux package coverage added to package adapter:
- `.deb` now parses deterministic AR entry metadata (bounded, no extraction/exec).
- `.rpm` now captures deterministic lead/header/script/signing hint counters from local bytes only.
- `.appimage` now captures deterministic ELF/runtime header hints (analysis-only; execution withheld).
- Archive/package tar coverage expanded:
- `.tar.xz/.txz` now follow explicit tar-plugin, fail-closed handling in archive/package lanes.
- macOS installer coverage added to package adapter:
- `.pkg` now captures deterministic XAR header and script/permission hint counters.
- `.dmg` now captures deterministic trailer marker hints (`koly`) without mounting.
- Document adapter deepened for `.docm/.xlsm`:
- ZIP structure + relationships are inspected deterministically for macro/embed/external-link indicators.
- IaC/CI adapter extraction deepened:
- Deterministic action reference parsing now distinguishes pinned commit/digest refs from unpinned refs.
- Remote module/source indicators and external runner signals are counted with structured counters in adapter summary output.
- Container adapter extraction deepened:
- OCI layout counts now include manifest and blob counts.
- Container tarball detection now recognizes Docker-style markers (`manifest.json` + `repositories`) and OCI tar markers (`oci-layout` + `index.json` + `blobs/sha256/*`) for local tar inputs.
- Explicit OCI layout route now fails closed when manifests exist but blob evidence is missing (`CONTAINER_LAYOUT_INVALID`), preventing partial container identity acceptance.
- SBOM JSON parsing now emits bounded package/component counts when present.
- Signature/cert adapter extraction deepened:
- Deterministic PEM block counting for certificate/PKCS7/signature material.
- Binary OID hint counts added for CMS signedData and timestamp EKU indicators.
- Explicit signature route now requires real envelope/OID/DER evidence; text-only timestamp/chain hints no longer satisfy strict signature validity checks.
- SCM/source evidence adapter extraction deepened:
- Deterministic repo counters now include tree entry count, branch/tag ref counts, detached HEAD indicator, and working-tree entry count.
- SCM adapter now emits deterministic worktree state evidence (staged/unstaged/untracked counts) and `SCM_WORKTREE_DIRTY` when local repo state is dirty.
- SCM fallback hardening:
- When `git` commands are unavailable/failing, adapter now parses native `.git` reference material (`HEAD`, loose refs, packed-refs) deterministically for source evidence.
- Image adapter extraction deepened:
- Deterministic header evidence now includes ISO PVD, VHD footer, VHDX signature, QCOW2 magic/version, and VMDK descriptor/sparse-magic hints.
- Package/installer signing evidence deepened:
- Deterministic local signing hints now include PE cert-table presence for `.exe` and signature-entry hints for `.msix/.nupkg/.whl/.jar`.
- New package reason code support: `PACKAGE_SIGNING_INFO_PRESENT` alongside existing unavailable paths.
- Container scan now emits adapter metadata/signals plus adapter artifacts using the same deterministic contract as safe-run adapters.
- Container scan evidence remains local-only inspect data and excludes unstable fields (timestamps/raw env/path values).
- Wave coverage now includes:
- Wave 1: archives, packages/installers, extensions
- Wave 2 baseline: IaC/CICD and document risk signal extraction
- Wave 3 baseline: container/source/signature/image evidence lanes
- Core/runtime trust hardening sweep applied in release scope (digest/trust/runtime path updates, host verification flow updates, and aligned fixture/contract updates).
- Builder integration surface explicitly supported: `weftend export-json <outRoot> --format normalized_v0` emits deterministic `weftend.normalizedSummary/0` output for downstream tools (see docs/POWERED_BY_WEFTEND.md).
- Shortcut scan accuracy fix for .lnk targets: report and compare now resolve the actual target script/program instead of effectively classifying the shell host.
- Baseline decision flow hardening for CHANGED/BLOCKED runs in Launchpad paths (accept/decline prompt reliability and gating behavior).
- Native report viewer workflow is the default operator path; Notepad is no longer the primary report UX.
- Report viewer startup hardened: host console launches hidden while the report viewer opens in normal visible state for review.
- Launchpad History UX improvements: direct View Report action and keyboard open behavior (double-click/Enter).
- New bind/unbind right-click flow:
- Bind to WeftEnd and Unbind from WeftEnd verbs for files, shortcuts, and folders.
- .lnk rewrap mode preserves icon and stores an original shortcut backup for safe restoration.
- Legacy metadata compatibility fixes prevent stale-state and strict-mode unbind failures.
- Shell integration simplification: only WeftEnd Launchpad and WeftEnd Download shortcuts are installed by default.
- Structured report artifacts available for UI and automation:
- report_card_v0.json
- report_card.txt

Validation
- npm run compile --silent: pass
- node dist/src/tools/windows_shell_assets.test.js: pass
- node dist/src/tools/greenteam/release_artifacts_present.test.js: pass
- npm test: pass (on release hardening sweep state)

Not included
- Malware scoring or reputation.
- Cloud analysis or telemetry.
- Automatic execution of native binaries outside explicit gated flows.
- Automatic trust root generation.

Operator notes
- Standard and portable release zips each ship with a .sha256 file for verification.
- Use published release zips, not GitHub auto-generated source archives, for operator installs.
- STATUS SAME can occur after a changed run if that changed state was accepted as the current baseline.
- See docs/DISCLAIMER.md for legal scope and non-guarantees.
